# Week 2, lab 2a

here is my code and work for lab 2a of this class

a:
```python
print("All the world's a stage,")
print("And all the men and women merely players: ")
print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages.")
```
b:
```python
print("All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts,His acts being seven ages.")
```
c:

the output of the following statement "print("127","0","0","1",sep=".")" is: 127.0.0.1

d:

a computer countdown would be an example of needing to use flush, because if you dont use flush, then it will only show you the countdown when it is finished., wheras when you use flush, it desplays it after print is excecuted opposed to the whole code.

e:

end="/n' is the reason that it seems like print runs automatically, because that is the automatic option for the end function, which forces the print function to flush, but if you change end, it removes flush.

f (challenges i experienced): I didnt really have any challenges with the code or understanding it, mostly just with learing how to use pycharm, and how to format everything in github, but other than that everything is good! your videos helped a lot!
